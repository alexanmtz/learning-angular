# Learning Angular

A project with a simple product page to getting started with Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.1.

# Steps

- Reading documentation in how to getting started with Angular
- Installed Angular with the CLI
- Installed Material Angular
- Reading about Material Angular and how use the UI components in an Angular application
- Setup tests
- Main page with some styling
- Documentation

# Next steps

- Finish home page HTML and CSS
- Make a template from that page, cause it can be reused for the ADD / EDIT page
- Create services that will connect to the API to add products, and get products from the data source
- Binding forms to react to data input and make the proper requests on the back-end to do the CRUD
- Keep testing what it was implemented
- Setup some development tools, like linting


# Considerations about learning angular

- The Angular concepts has a higher learning curve than others Frond-end frameworks like React and Vue.js, but it's a powerful framework and well structured with TypeScript
- The Angular CLI is awesome and good to start the project, as create components and modules, and the testing infrastructure including e2e testing
- I couldn't move forward on data bindings, services and other angular concepts to connect with data, so I did a mocked version


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
